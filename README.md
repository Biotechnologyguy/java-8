## Introduction

Java 8 brought significant enhancements and new features to the language, making it more expressive, concise, and powerful. This repository serves as a learning resource for understanding and practicing these features.

## Java 8 Features

### Lambda Expressions

Lambda expressions enable you to treat functionality as a method argument or to create anonymous inner classes more concisely.

### Functional Interfaces

Functional interfaces are interfaces with a single abstract method. They are key to using lambda expressions and method references.

### Stream API

The Stream API introduces functional-style operations to work with collections in a more concise and expressive manner.

### Optional

Optional is a container object used to represent a value that may or may not be present.

### Default Methods

Default methods allow you to add new methods to interfaces without breaking existing implementations.

### Method References

Method references provide a way to refer to methods or constructors without invoking them.

### Date and Time API

Java 8 introduced a new Date and Time API to address the shortcomings of the old java.util.Date and java.util.Calendar classes.

### CompletableFuture

CompletableFuture provides a way to perform asynchronous computations and handle their results asynchronously.

### New APIs

Java 8 introduced several new APIs and utility methods to enhance the language and standard library.

## Code Examples

You'll find code examples demonstrating each of these Java 8 features in the repository.

### Happy Learning!
